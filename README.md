# Home_Sales
This is my UT Bootcamp Module 22 Challenge

## Summary
In this challenge, I will use my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then I will use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

Runtimes between cached table and uncached table, and partition data are also recorded for comparison.
